### Today I worked on Exercise 29 on Codedex.io. I learned how to create and call a function ###

import random
def fortune():
  luck = random.randint(0,7)
  if luck == 0:
    print("Dont't pursue happiness - create it.")
  elif luck == 1:
    print("All things are difficult before they are easy")
  elif luck == 2:
    print('THe early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.')
  elif luck == 3:
    print('Someone in your life needs a letter from you.')
  elif luck == 4: 
    print("Don't just twink. ACT!")
  elif luck == 5:
    print('Your hearth will skip a beat')
  elif luck == 6:
    print('The fortune you search for is in another cookie')
  else:
    print("Help! I'm being help prisoner in a Chinese bakery!")


fortune()

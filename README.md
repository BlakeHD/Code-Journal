# Code-Journal

Welcome to my coding journal! My name is Blake, and here I'll document my journey of learning to code! Allthough this isn't intended for public use, I am leaving this public as motivation for me and inspiration for any beginner to coding. If I can do this you can too! This repository serves as a log of my progress, notes, and reflections.
